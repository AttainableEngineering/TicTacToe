Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! Written by Carlos Ortiz

To run Tic Tac Toe, you can either run the TicTacToe file as main 
OR for a less cluttered option, you can run MAIN_PlayTTT.

These have the same functionality, but TicTacToe has the function defined and
MAIN has an import and much less cluttered code (2 lines).

When the TicTacToe function is running, you can play by inputting a row and column
corresponding to the position desired. Two players can play by alternating inputs.

The gameboard is laid out as:
 --- --- ---
|1,1|1,2|1,3|
 --- --- ---
|2,1|2,2|2,3|
 --- --- ---
|3,1|3,2|3,3|
 --- --- ---
